# Encrypted

Creating a messaging app with End-to-End chat encryption. Implementing the creation of user accounts and securely store the user's data, handling user sessions and using Two-Factor authentication for additional security.

## Project Proposal

### Project Goal
Build an End-to-End Chat Encryption

### Project Description
Creating a messaging app with End-to-End chat encryption. Implementing the creation of user accounts and securely store the user's data, handling user sessions and using Two-Factor authentication for additional security.

### Project Schedule

#### Week 1
Understand the scope of the project; fully understand what End-to-End encryption demands, as well as Two-Factor authentication. Complete planning for the project throughout the next few weeks.

#### Week 2
Project set-up on GitHub, explore other areas where the security of the application might be exploited, and come up with a plan to mitigate this.

Implementation of user creation and logging in.

<b>Note:</b> Project Proposal Due Wednesday 9 am [With Week 1 Logbook]

#### Week 3
Research and implement an innovative encryption algorithm.

Implementing the use of biometric authentication.

Implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.

Start building simple frontend for registration and logging in.

#### Week 4
Implementation of sending messages with End-to-End encryption.

Prepare for the Mid-Term Progress Video - make slides and ensure that demo is working.

#### Week 5
Implementing secure sessions to prevent Session Hijacking.

Implement permission controls, so only authorised users can access protected information.

<b>Note:</b> Mid-Term Progress Video Due Wednesday 9 am [Week 4 Activity]

#### Week 6
-- Flexibility Week --

Implement an End-to-End encrypted voice call and file sharing.

#### Week 7
Implementing the Two-Factor authentication by sending TOTP through email.

Implementing image encryption.

#### Week 8
Improve existing frontend solution where needed.

Prepare for the Final Project Video - make slides and ensure that demo is working.

<b>Note:</b> Final Report Deliverable Due Friday

### Project Deliverables and Outcomes
The project will produce a functioning application where many aspects of security, such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks, session hijacking and some other types of security attacks are considered and will be prevented by implementing the appropriate measures.

I will be developing a strong understanding of the possible security attacks to web applications and how I can prevent attacks from happening, as well as several encryption algorithms to ensure an End-to-End encryption of the application.
